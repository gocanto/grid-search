## Products overview simulator

This project simulates a given e-commerce store back-office products list overview.

## Dev Requirements

To make use of this code base, you will have to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>=12` and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in your local machine or container.

Once you have those tools installed, you will be able to do the following:

- Within your local console, go to the directory of your preference and type 
  `git@github.com:gocanto/grid-search.git`.
  
- Next, you will be able to CD into the newly created directory, like so `cd grid-search`.

- Now, you are able to type the following commands in order for you to run the app.
```bash
    npm install && npm run dev #to compile the app    
    npm run watch #to compile the app and have an instant feedback while developping
    npm run hot #to allow for hot module reloding while in development mode
    npm run dev #to compile the app for development
    npm run prod #to compile the app for production
```    

Alternatively, you would be able to download the compiled app from [here](https://github.com/gocanto/grid-search/tree/main/dist).
